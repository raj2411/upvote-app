The Upvote App is a React-based application that allows users to interact with upvote buttons. The app features reusable components, dynamic state management, and persistent data storage in the browser. It showcases a simple upvote system where users can toggle the state of individual upvotes, manage multiple upvote lists, and add new upvotes to each list.
